# SitecoreSkeleton8.2
A basic Sitecore skeleton project with a hello world page.

This repo is based on [this guide](https://www.techguilds.com/blog/2018/07/back-to-basics-how-to-set-up-a-sitecore-helix-solution-from-scratch) on setting up a Habitat Solution from scratch. It contains all the code as explained in the demo.
You will need to add and edit items in the site's Content Editor as shown in the guid and then build and publish this project as is to a new instance and the site should be ready.
